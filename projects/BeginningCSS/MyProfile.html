    <h1>Arielle Blessy Reverente</h1>
    <p>I am an international student at BYU–Hawaii who studies and works on campus. I started my first job in Student Professional Development, where I helped lead student groups, train new workers, and plan team activities in the Office of Information Technology. I was promoted to &lt;Call Center Team Manager &gt;, and I enjoy working with people, leading teams, and learning how technology can help students.</p>
    <p>On a personal note I <mark>love </mark> spending time with my friends and I feel <em>happy</em> when I am with them. Being around them makes me feel content and valued, even without words. I <strong>enjoy</strong> serving them because, in many ways, they serve me too without realizing it. we naturally connect through the same music, shared interests and being on the same wavelength. </p>
