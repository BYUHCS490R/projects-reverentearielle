        <h2>Why I Like South Korean Media</h2>
        <p><strong>KPOP</strong>
            <br> I enjoy listening to K-pop groups like Blackpink and Twice because their music is energetic, creative, and uplifting. Their performances, fashion, and music videos make the experience fun and exciting.</p>

        <p><strong>K-DRAMA</strong>
            <br>I also enjoy watching K-dramas, particularly fantasy and romance genres. These shows often have strong emotional stories, beautiful cinematography. Watching K-dramas helps me relax and gives me something positive to look forward to.

        <p><strong>RELATIVE LINK </strong> <br> is a link that connects to another page within the same website using the files location instead of a full web address. An example of a relative link is my profile page: <a href="MyProfile.html">My Profile</a>
        <br>
        <strong>ABSOLUTE LINK</strong> is a full web address that links to an external website on the internet. Here is an absolute link to a website about My favorite K-POP Group: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GnRl2c7Zhk">BLACKPINK MOMENTS</a>

        <ul>
            <li>What color did you choose to emphasize text?
                <span class="highlight">Dark Pink</span>
            </li>
            <li>What color did you choose to de-emphasize text?:<span class="muted">gray</span> </li>
            <li>How did you choose your colors?
                I chose soft pink colors so the text is easy to read.
