        <p><strong>KPOP</strong>
            <br> I enjoy listening to K-pop groups like Blackpink and Twice because their music is energetic, creative, and uplifting. Their performances, fashion, and music videos make the experience fun and exciting.</p>

        <p><strong>K-DRAMA</strong>
            <br>I also enjoy watching K-dramas, particularly fantasy and romance genres. These shows often have strong emotional stories, beautiful cinematography. Watching K-dramas helps me relax and gives me something positive to look forward to.
